  				<h1>Hello I'm Bertille</h1>
				<img src="image/picture.jpg" class="img-circle" width="240px" alt="Bertille">
				<p>I am 18 years old. I lived with my family in Paris until I moved to Lille last August for my studies. I am passionate about fashion, drawing and design in general. I develop my creativity by traveling and discovering new horizons, which make me leave my daily comfort. Music is also an important part of my life. You can find out more about the practices of my passions and my educational background with my CV below!</p>

				<h2>Fashion</h2>
				<p>Passionate about fashion, I would like to work in this sector later on. I develop this passion by creating clothes of my invention. Drawing is also a way for me to develop my creativity and to draw patterns and outfits that inspire me.</p>

				<h2>Travel</h2>
				<p>I love to travel around the world. It makes me discover new cultures, new ways of life. I often traveled as a child with my family and continue to develop this hobby with my friends or sometimes even alone. I would very much like my future job to be closely linked to the international scene: I consider it very important, the diversity of the world can help everyone.</p>

				<h2>Music</h2>
				<p>I was born into a musical family which allowed me to develop this musical inclination that I have in me. I am passionate about singing and have been practicing music for years. Music is therefore an important part of my daily life. It is a way to develop my creativity.</p>
